# A quantitative framework for valuation multiples computation in mergers and acquisitions: integrating bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, principal component analysis, and predictive modeling

## Abstract

This study starts from the traditional process of estimating a company's valuation multiples and proposes a rigorously quantitative approach to generalize it. The study focuses on publicly traded U.S. companies under SIC code 35 to develop a machine learning model that, based on the financial and operational characteristics of these companies, can predict the most appropriate valuation multiple for a target firm in the same industry. By testing three different algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine) with three different test set sizes, the study presents a model that can describe the variability in the sample data with an R-squared of 0.314. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the models including business descriptions encoded into vectors via BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) outperform the models employing the traditional SIC code classification method in a statistically significant manner.
